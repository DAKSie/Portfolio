## As compensation for my late submission I had added a 3 new features.
- feedback system
- firebase
- Ai based feedback moderation
-----
### Feedback system
Is really just a comment section in my portfolio where people can leave their thoughts about me or the portfolio.

-----
### Firebase
This is where the feedback is stored.

-----

### Ai based feedback moderation
this checks if the feedback is appropriate, rejecting any irrelevant, offensive, derogatory texts submitted.

-----

I hope this is stil graded despite the fact that it is an exit ticket and I had missed my submission because my internet had been cut off during the class.

# HOW TO RUN

just clone and open index.html

My secret keys are stored in there, please don't abuse it. I am a poor student and very tired of implementing environment variables in plain javascript.
